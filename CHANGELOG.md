# Development Version

* faster cleaning of build and dist folder
* use one global tmp folder for both build and dist
* updated grunticon to 1.2.13 (because of strange tmp-folder behaviour!)
* removed `partials/icon-sprite.svg` from source folder, is stored in tmp folder now
* always use sass cache in dev, disable it for dist
* removed unused `compass.fonts_dir` and `compass.javascripts_dir`
* added `*.gif` for `imagemin` task
* `icon-sprite.svg` is part of the gitignore now (since it's generated by `svgmin:dev`/`svgmin:dist`)
* replaced svgmin:bgs + svgmin:icons with svgmin:dist + svgmin:dev
* use build/tmp and dist/tmp folder for temporary svgmin/grunticon svg files
* Added `Gemfile.lock` to `.gitignore`

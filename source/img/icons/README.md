# The Icons-Folder

Put your SVG-Icons in here.  

All icons will be processed with the svgmin-task and put in the svgmin-folder.  
Afterwards the grunticon-task uses these icons to produce  

- the png-fallback-files, which will be put into png-fallback/
- the SCSS-files (all icons are included as data-URIs), which will be put into sass/grunticon
